diff_tomo \- Azimuthal integration for diffraction tomograph
.SH DESCRIPTION
usage: diff_tomo [options] \fB\-p\fR ponifile imagefiles*
.PP
Azimuthal integration for diffraction tomography. Diffraction tomography is an
experiment where 2D diffraction patterns are recorded while performing a 2D
scan, one (the slowest) in rotation around the sample center and the other
(the fastest) along a translation through the sample. Diff_tomo is a script
(based on pyFAI and h5py) which allows the reduction of this 4D dataset into a
3D dataset containing the rotations angle (hundreds), the translation step
(hundreds) and the many diffraction angles (thousands). The resulting dataset
can be opened using the PyMca ROItool where the 1d dataset has to be selected
as last dimension. The output file aims at being NeXus compliant. This tool
can be used for mapping experiments if one considers the slow scan direction
as the rotation. but the *diff_map* tool provides in addition a graphical user
interface.
