.SH NAME
pyFAI-integrate \- Graphical interface for azimuthal integration
.SH DESCRIPTION
usage: pyFAI\-integrate [options] file1.edf file2.edf ...
.PP
PyFAI\-integrate is a graphical interface (based on Python/Qt4) to perform
azimuthal integration on a set of files. It exposes most of the important
options available within pyFAI and allows you to select a GPU (or an openCL
platform) to perform the calculation on.

PyFAI\-integrate saves all parameters in a .azimint.json (hidden) file. This
JSON file is an ascii file which can be edited and used to configure online
data analysis using the LImA plugin of pyFAI. Nota: there is bug in debian6
making the GUI crash (to be fixed inside pyqt) http://bugs.debian.org/cgibin/bugreport.cgi?bug=697348
