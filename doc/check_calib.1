.SH DESCRIPTION
usage: check_calib [options] \fB\-p\fR param.poni image.edf
.PP
Check_calib is a research tool aiming at validating both the geometric
calibration and everything else like flat\-field correction, distortion
correction, at a sub\-pixel level. Note that `check_calib` program is obsolete
as the same functionality is available from within pyFAI\-calib, using the
`validate` command in the refinement process.
