.SH NAME
pyFAI-average \- image preprocessing tool
.SH DESCRIPTION
usage: pyFAI\-average [options] [options] \fB\-o\fR output.edf file1.edf file2.edf ...
.PP
This tool can be used to average out a set of dark current images using mean
or median filter (along the image stack). One can also reject outliers be
specifying a cutoff (remove cosmic rays / zingers from dark)

It can also be used to merge many images from the same sample when using a
small beam and reduce the spotty\-ness of Debye\-Sherrer rings. In this case the
"max\-filter" is usually recommended.
