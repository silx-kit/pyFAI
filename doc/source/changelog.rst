Change-log of versions
======================

2025.XX YY/XX/2025
------------------
- [GUI] Like `silx`, `pyFAI` moves from pyQt5 to pySide6 (or pyQt6). Several bugs were found
  and addressed to increase compatibility with Qt6. PyQt5 is no more a priority.
- [Pilx] now compatible with files produced by mesh-scan on BM29 in addition to diffmap.
- [medfilt] fix an infinite in the OpenCL code
- [Doc] Improve the notebook about "flatfield" calculation.
- Supports python 3.1-3.13/4?
- List of contributors for this release: Loic Huder, Edgar Gutierrez-Fernandez and Jérôme Kieffer

2025.03 14/03/2025
------------------

- Bug fix version (Thanks to Fred Picca/Debian for testing on many architectures)
- Use automatically dynamic mask for Dectris detector data

  * Automatically recognizes and masks out bad pixel
  * `dummy` and `delta_dummy` values are already known from the manufacturer
  * empty bins are no more marked with the `dummy` value (which can be very large for Eiger) but with the `empty` value which is fully under control of the user, 0.0 by default.

- Improve the plot generated by the benchmarking tool (Thanks to Jon)
- `MultiGeometry` allows the mixing of different kind of detectors (Thanks ThomasK)
- `WorkerConfig` dataclass, many fixes at several places, Ewoks compatibility.
- `Diffmap` compatiblity with binned images
- `Pilx` uses now the dynamic mask to hide hot/defective pixels
- Improvement of the `fake_calibration_image` to provide both `Imin` and `Imax`
- New Lambda 9M detector
- Improved support of FiberIntegrator for using the correct fiber units and key parameters
- Supports python 3.9 to 3.13. The GIL-free version on python 3.13 is untested.
- Tested by the developers on Windows (amd64), linux (amd64, arm64 and ppc64le) and MacOS (amd64 and arm64).
- A dozen of Pull-requests by Thomas Kluyver, Loic Huder, Edgar Gutierrez-Fernandez and Jérôme Kieffer

2025.01 31/01/2025
------------------

- Refactoring of the integrator classes:

  * Azimuthal integrator moved to ``pyFAI.integrator.azimuthal``
  * Most common code into ``pyFAI.integrator.common`` (including a lot of *deprecated* stuff)
  * New sub-module dedicated to fiber/surface diffraction (``pyFAI.integrator.fiber``)
  * Engine loading is now in ``pyFAI.integrator.load_engines``
  * Those are all (still) sub-classes of each-other but it will change in the futrure where they will need to be **promoted** to transfer all the geometry and enable other's class feature. For example: ``ai.promote("FiberIntegrator")`` or ``ai.promote("GeometryRefinement")``

- Refactoring of the handling of the serialization of the ``pyFAI-integrate`` GUI and ``pyFAI.worker.Worker`` into a JSON file.

  * Use a **dataclass** defined in ``pyFAI.io.integration_config.WorkerConfig`` to manage all parameters to configure the ``Worker``
  * New format version 5, enables the handling of sigma-clip & median filtering
  * Provides better compatibility with `Ewoks <https://ewoks.esrf.fr>`_

- Median filtering for 1D filtering:

  * includes quantile average
  * available in Python, Cython & OpenCL
  * `Performances charts for sigma-clip & median filter <https://github.com/silx-kit/pyFAI/blob/main/doc/source/usage/tutorial/AzimuthalFilter.ipynb>`_.

- New FiberIntegrator class for grazing-incidence/fiber scattering data (former fiber/gi methods in a new API)

  * FiberIntegrator located in ``pyFAI.integrator.fiber``
  * Usage tutorial in `doc/source/usage/tutorial/FiberGrazingIncidence.ipynb` or https://www.silx.org/doc/pyFAI/dev/usage/tutorial/FiberGrazingIncidence.html
  * `integrate2d_grazing_incidence` method to display qIP - qOOP patterns. New API with minimum inputs
  * `integrate1d_grazing_incidence` method to perform qIP or qOOP slices. New API with minimum inputs
  * Corrected equations to handle `incident_angle` and `tilt_angle` parameters
  * 8 possible `sample_orientation` (1-8), to rotate and flip the qIP-qOOP maps (or other units)
  * `integrate2d_polar` to represent the polar angle (arctan(qOOP/qIP)) versus the q modulus
  * `integrate1d_polar` to integrate the polar angle map (vertical or horizontal)
  * `integrate2d_exitangles` to reshape the diffraction pattern into horizontal and vertical exit angles, with the origin in the sample horizon
  * `integrate1d_exitangles` to perform an integration across one of the exit angles
  * Faster calculation with `numexpr` package formulas

- New MultiGeometryFiber in `pyFAI.multi_geometry`

  * Analog to MultiGeometry class.
  * Instead of taking a list of AzimuthalIntegrators, it takes a list of FiberIntegrators
  * Access to integrate1d and integrate2d grazing_incidence/fiber methods
  * New tutorial of usage in doc/source/usage/tutorial/MultiGeometry/MultiGeometryFiber.ipynb`
