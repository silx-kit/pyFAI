Tutorials
=========

Tutorials explain the Python interface of *pyFAI* and use the jupyter notebook
interface, formerly known as ipython notebooks.
The two first tutorials are an introduction to the usage of pyFAI from Python for
diffraction data reduction.
The subsequent tutorials are more in depth explanation and require
a good Python fluency and to a certain extent, of the pyFAI library.
