Example of usage
================

This section presents typical usage of the *pyFAI* library.

It starts with recipies which present typical applications
like calibration of an experimental setup or integration of an image.
Those cookbooks are short tutorials which explain how to use *pyFAI* on a
practical example (5 mn to read).

Tutorials explain the Python interface of *pyFAI* and use the *Jupyter Notebook*
interface.
The two first tutorials are an introduction to the usage of *pyFAI* from Python for
diffraction data reduction.
The subsequent tutorials are more in depth explanation and require
a good Python fluency and to a certain extent, of the *pyFAI* library.
